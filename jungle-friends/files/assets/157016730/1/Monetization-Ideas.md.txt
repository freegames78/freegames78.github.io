## Monkey Mart Monetization Subject
- Showed 2x money reward at 20 second
- Show 10+ reward at 50 second
- Showed 2x money reward at 1 minute 20 second
- Show 10+ reward at 1 minute 50 second

## More monetization ideas
- When all money collected, it's a natural break point
- When an ads offered, but users didn't interact with it (since they lost an opportunity)



## 5 Dec
+ Lucky spin
+ Vulpes will come and offer lucky spin (pirate + eye patch)

+ With this offer button, you can get 2X more revenue, one reward ads (1 minute) (every 4 minutes)

+ When user click to buy something, but doesn't have money, we can offer them a money pack for reward ads
+ Coin pack for 2 reward ads for 200 coins (2 ads)

- When they are back to game, they can collect their daily reward, we can have a cool render for it, this would basically calculate coins while they are gone and give them coins if they watch ads

## 29 November
- From calculations it seems like our reward ads will be 0.4

## Feature Ideas
- Deer can bring us a box and that box would trigger a popup, we can give a surprise item to users with reward ads
- We can drop a golden ticket with a bird, and that golden ticket can put us into a mini game with reward ads, we can have a cool render for it

- Pig Race


## Monetization Ideas
+ If they ever close the popup without watching an ad to wait for reward, show midroll.
+ If they don't have unicycle, off them unicycle
