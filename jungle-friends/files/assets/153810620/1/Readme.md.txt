## Iteration - A.4
- Cash machine removed from map.
- Once they unlock two machines that basically useless to them, they lose their interest.
- There is no instant graficiation with animals going and delivering money to the cash machine, it's pointless.



- They wait a lot for the first customer
- When they unlock second one, they just leave, it's not interesting anymore (maybe add plate unlocking to upgrade menu with exponantially more money)
- They can just go and unlock campfire with bad showprice change
- When there was an extra wood, they couldn't leave, focus on previous todo list

- Upgrade for stations, where we can buy more, with plus button to max could be a better approach

- Fast Grow Potion: Speed up the growth of your farm crops or heal wounded animals faster. This potion is available after watching an ad.

personal notes
- jungle friends didn't give the same excitement of rainbow, he instantly said I like it without even playing it, reasons could be:
- - Visuals (super bright colors)
- - Sound (funky music)

excitement
- I like it
- You guys made this?
- Raaaiinnbooow

progression
- even tho he completes, he didn't feel that?
- he saw the game with camera angle and he said woah, so we need somehow give them an impression how big it can get, like I don't know zoom out somehow?

overall
- rainbow challenging but exciting at the same time frustrating
- other than little frustrating stuff on jungle, it's low, but there is no excitement too

objective
