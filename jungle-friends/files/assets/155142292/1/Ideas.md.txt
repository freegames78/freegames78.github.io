- Provide them home, train them and use them on quests

- Quests

## Engagement
- "Inventory Expansion" - Watch an ad to temporarily expand the inventory for a set period, like 24 hours. Makes it feel like they're getting a special power-up.

- "Quick Sort" - If the inventory is cluttered, watching an ad could instantly organize it, maybe even auto-selling or combining lesser items.

- "Item Lock" - Players can lock a valuable item so it won't be accidentally sold or used. Normally it costs in-game currency, but an ad could do it for free.

- "Priority Delivery" - If the inventory is full when a shipment arrives, watching an ad could allow the special items from the shipment to be added despite the limit.

- Daily quests, like "Harvest Challenge" or "Builder's Quest," to bring players back every day.
- Leaderboards to fuel competitive spirit.
- Special timed events that offer unique rewards.
- Challenges that require collaboration, perhaps unlocking social features as they progress.
- A collection system, maybe with exotic animals, to keep players hunting for the next rare item.

## Monetization
- Reward ads for speeding up in-game processes, like crop growth or building construction.
- Reward ads for getting extra storage space in your inventory.
- Non-intrusive mid-roll ads, potentially after achieving certain milestones.
- Integrating ads into the shipment box mechanic, either to speed up delivery or unlock additional goodies.
- The VIP pass idea, giving an ad-free experience and other benefits for a period of time.
- And a streak reward system where watching ads daily could multiply the bonuses.
